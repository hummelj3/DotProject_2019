Info on Program:
Quadrants are as follows, quadrant 1: bottom right, quadrant 2: top right, quadrant 3: top left, quadrant 4: bottom left. 
Dot is 11 pixels wide and tall.
Circle has a radius of 400.5 pixels. 
Dot will spawn from 5 - 40 degrees from start of each quadrant.
Angles are in radians
All dimensions are measured in pixels.
NOTE!: "Graph" per say of everything is flipped in an odd way. The top left corner of the screen is point (0,0). X get larger as point goes right ->
Y gets larger as point goes down from top of screen.
quadrant 1 is bottom right
quadrant 2 is upper right
quadrant 3 is upper left
quadrant 4 is bottom left
Conversions for pixels:
	1 pixel (X) = 0.0264583333 cm
	1 cm = 37.7952755906 pixel (X)
